## Description
The top of the Amazon Web Services training and development skills. This section is for personal and professional information. 
### Getting started
- Create an Amazon Web Services or AWS account using your STG email, i.e. someone@stgconsulting.com
    - The best place to started is of course: [Getting Started](hLattps://aws.amazon.com/getting-started), for now, 
      just use the "Root user sign in".  Just stick with the [free](https://aws.amazon.com/free) for now.
    - Later on this account will be used to create Proof-of-Concepts or PoFs for clients and will be paid for by the 
      client or STG and given access to, i.e. EC2, S3, etc...
- Create an Amazon Partner Network account, using your STG email.
    - Answer all the questions as if you are a Developer, and understand that Share Ralph is the STG lead. The 
      information you enter will be added to STG APN statistics. You will be asked for a password prior to creating
      your account.
    - Familiarize yourself with the information provided regarding the APN, especially note the training envolved 
    to be accredited and certified. You want to find [APN Partner Training](https://www.aws.training/PartnerTraining) to 
      explore the Training options.
    - Enroll in Digital Training by selecting the "Find Training" button.   
    - The course I am currently taking is the "AWS Technical Profession", it has about 6-7 modules with a test 
    at the end of the course.
